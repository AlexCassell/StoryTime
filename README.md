# Story Time

[Click here to see this Fullstack App in Action](https:www.storytime.alexcassell.com)

Fill in some variables and hit create and this app will use your input, as well as randomize parts of the text to create a unique story.  Currently it only utilizes one story, so it is not as unique as the finished product would be.


This is just a proof of concept, several features are not fully implemented.  The code for this project is being used as the basis for a Twitter Bot that takes in texts and spits out an 'original' text.




Known Bugs:

1.  Random sometimes fails to load a story.
